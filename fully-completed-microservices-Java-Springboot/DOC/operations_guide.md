# Operations Guide & Cheatsheet

This document provides quick commands and scripts to manage the microservices ecosystem.

## 🚀 One-Click Startup (Recommended)

We have created automated scripts to handle the complex startup sequence for you.

### Start Everything
Run this from the project root (`fully-completed-microservices-Java-Springboot`):
```powershell
.\scripts\start_all.ps1
```
*   **What it does**: Opens 8 separate PowerShell windows, one for each service.
*   **Sequence**: Config Server -> Discovery Service -> All others.

### Stop Everything
```powershell
.\scripts\stop_all.ps1
```
*   **What it does**: Forcefully terminates all Java processes to ensure ports are freed.

### 🏗️ Build & Maintenance

### Build All Services
```powershell
.\scripts\build_all.ps1
```
*   **What it does**: Runs `mvn clean package -DskipTests` for every service sequentially.
*   **Use when**: You've made changes to multiple services or want to verify the entire project compiles.

### Clean All
```powershell
.\scripts\clean_all.ps1
```
*   **What it does**: Removes the `target/` directory from all services.
*   **Use when**: You want to free up disk space or force a fresh compilation.

### 🔍 Monitoring & Testing

### Check Status
```powershell
.\scripts\check_status.ps1
```
*   **What it does**: Pings all actuator health endpoints to see which services are UP or DOWN.

### Run E2E Tests
```powershell
.\scripts\run_tests.ps1
```
*   **What it does**: Executes the full integration test suite (Customer -> Product -> Order).

## 🛠️ Manual Build & Run Commands

If you prefer running services manually or need to debug a specific one:

### 1. Infrastructure (Docker)
Ensure your databases and message brokers are up before starting Java apps.
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Maven Commands
You can run these in the directory of any service (e.g., `services/order`).

| Goal | Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Run Locally** | `mvn spring-boot:run` | Starts the app on localhost. |
| **Clean Build** | `mvn clean package` | Compiles code and verifies tests. |
| **Skip Tests** | `mvn clean package -DskipTests` | Faster build, skips unit tests. |
| **Build Image** | `mvn spring-boot:build-image` | Creates a Docker image using Cloud Native Buildpacks. |
