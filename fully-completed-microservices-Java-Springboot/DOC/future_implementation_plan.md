# Future Phase Implementation Plan

This document outlines the proposed next steps for evolving the microservices ecosystem. It focuses on resiliency, observability, automation, and user accessibility.

---

## 🛡️ Phase 1: Resiliency & Fault Tolerance

**Goal**: Ensure the system handles failures gracefully according to distributed system patterns.

### Proposed Changes
- **Circuit Breaker Testing**: Manually disable the `payment-service` and verify that the `order-service` enters a "half-open" state or returns a meaningful fallback.
- **Kafka Buffering**: Stop the `notification-service`, place an order, then restart the service to verify that Kafka persists the message and the notification is eventually delivered.
- **Database Failover**: (Optional) Test the reconnection logic of Spring Data JPA/MongoDB when their respective containers are restarted.

## 🔍 Phase 2: Deep Observability Analysis

**Goal**: Optimize performance and trace complicated asynchronous flows.

### Proposed Changes
- **Zipkin Trace Audit**: Perform a deep dive into the `/api/v1/orders` trace. Identify which hop (Product check, Customer check, or Payment) consumes the most time.
- **Log Correlation**: Standardize log formats across services to include Trace IDs, making it easier to search for a specific transaction in a centralized logging tool (e.g., ELK Stack or simply local `tail`).
- **Metric Exporting**: Configure **Prometheus** and **Grafana** to visualize CPU/Memory usage and request throughput.

## 🏗️ Phase 3: CI/CD & Automation

**Goal**: Professionalize the build and deployment lifecycle.

### Proposed Changes
- **GitHub Actions**: Create a `.github/workflows/build.yml` to:
  - Run Maven tests on every PR.
  - Build OCI images using `spring-boot:build-image`.
  - Push images to a registry (Docker Hub or GHCR).
- **Testcontainers Integration**: Implement integration tests in the `notification-service` that use real MongoDB/Kafka containers during the `mvn test` phase.
- **Script Refinement**: Expand `tests/run_test.ps1` to include automated assertions (checking status codes and response bodies).

---

## 🌐 Phase 4: UI Development (Frontend)

**Goal**: Provide a user-facing entry point for the API.

### Proposed Changes
- **React/Vite Application**:
  - **Catalog Page**: Fetch and display products from the `product-service` via the Gateway.
  - **Checkout Form**: A UI for creating a Customer and placing an Order.
  - **Order History**: Display recently placed orders.
- **CORS Configuration**: Update the `gateway-service` to allow requests from the new frontend origin.
